# Data-Analysis
This repo has notes on various topics like Time Series Analysis, Granger's Casualty Tests, etc.

The notes are created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). You can see the `.md` files in any markdown supported software but for better experience Obsidian is recommended(it's a really good software btw!)

It's best if you go through the numbering of files. The files that aren't numbered are linked within the numbered one so you can study chronologically.
