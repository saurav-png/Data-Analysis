**An ARIMA model can be understood by outlining each of its components as follows:**

- **Autoregression (AR)**: refers to a model that shows a changing variable that regresses on its own lagged, or prior values.
- **Integrated (I)**_:_ represents the differencing of raw observations to allow the time series to become stationary (i.e., data values are replaced by the difference between the data values and the previous values).
- **Moving average (MA)**:  incorporates the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.


### Autoregression(AR) Model:

*I found the video below to be really helpful. It's short, clear and concise.*

### Moving Average(MA) Model:

*Again, the same channel explains this beautifully.*
